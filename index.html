                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the 3D Surround Music Player X mobile application (the "App"), a service provided by Popes. The App is designed to operate offline, providing a music listening experience from files stored on your device without the need for an internet connection. Your privacy is very important to us. This policy is intended to help you understand what data we process, why we process it, and your rights in this regard.</p>

                <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
                <p>The 3D Surround Music Player X App does not directly collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. This includes, but is not limited to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
                        <li>Your device's precise location (GPS data).</li>
                        <li>Your contacts, photos, or other personal files.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>All of your music listening data, including your listening statistics (total plays, skipped tracks, listening time), are stored **locally on your device** and are not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Data We Process on the Device</h2>
                <p>To provide its core functionality, the App processes the following data **exclusively on your device**:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Music Files:</strong> The App requires access to the audio files on your device to play music. This data is never transmitted off your device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Listening Stats:</strong> The App processes data such as song plays, listening time, and skips to generate your personalized statistics. This information remains local to the App's data on your device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> The App may access basic device information (e.g., screen size, operating system version) to ensure compatibility and proper display of the user interface. This information is not collected or transmitted off the device.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>While we do not collect personal data directly, our App uses third-party services that may collect data to function correctly. This is a crucial point for Google's Data safety section requirements.</p>
                <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Google Mobile Ads:</strong> The free version of this App displays advertisements to support its development. This service may collect and process information about your device and interests to serve personalized ads.
                        <br>
                        For more information on the data collected by this service, please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Google Mobile Ads privacy policy</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Google Play Services:</strong> This is a standard component of all Android devices used for various features, including crash reporting and app updates. This service may collect data on app usage and performance to help us identify and fix bugs.
                        <br>
                        For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services privacy policy</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Security</h2>
                <p>We value your trust in our App and strive to protect the data that is processed locally on your device. We do not transmit any of your local data to our servers. Your data's security is our priority, but please note that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                <p>3D Surround Music Player does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users. All app functionality operates entirely on your device.</p>

                <h2>What This Means:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>No user accounts or registration required.</li>
                    <li>No data is sent to external servers.</li>
                    <li>No tracking or analytics.</li>
                    <li>All music library information remains on your device.</li>
                    <li>App preferences are stored locally only.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Audio Processing</h2>
                <p>The app uses the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission solely for real-time audio waveform analysis to apply 3D surround sound effects during music playback. **No audio is recorded, saved, or transmitted outside the app.**</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Your Control</h2>
                <p>You maintain complete control over all app data by managing it through your device settings or by uninstalling the app.</p>
                <p>Since we do not collect personal data, traditional data subject rights (access, portability, deletion requests) do not apply to Popes. All data remains under your direct control on your device.</p>
